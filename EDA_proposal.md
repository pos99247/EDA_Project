### Exploratory Data Analysis with MTA Turnstile Data
Coca-cola just released a new type of soft drink.
They want to promote it by giving out samples in the entrances to new york subway stations.
They asked where at what times would be the most efficient way to advertise their product.


The data set will be the MTA turnstile data from 2018-06-02 to 2018-08-25.
The data was chosen from a pre covid time so we could calculate traffic in the subway when things get back to normal.
The data was chosen during summer when the city is the hottest.
The data will be modified using pandas and sql to extract useful info such as daily traffic/total traffic per station(maybe time could be another element).
Then by using matplotlib will plot charts/graphs to support analysis found with the data.
